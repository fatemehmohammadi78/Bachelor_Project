# Bachelor's Project: Market Basket Analysis

This repository contains my Bachelor's project titled "Market Basket Analysis." The project focuses on applying the Apriori model to analyze a market basket dataset, identifying significant patterns and correlations in customer purchasing behavior. The aim is to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations for business improvement.

You may read the full (Farsi) explanation from `doc/bachelor_project.pdf` file.

## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique widely used in retail and e-commerce to uncover associations and relationships between products that are frequently purchased together. By understanding these patterns, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, improve cross-selling opportunities, and enhance the overall customer shopping experience.

In this project, I leveraged the Apriori algorithm, a classic association rule mining technique, to analyze a real-world market basket dataset. The goal was to identify interesting and actionable relationships between products that could potentially lead to valuable business insights.

## Project Highlights

- Utilized the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from the market basket dataset.
- Performed extensive data preprocessing and data cleaning to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis results.
- Interpreted the extracted association rules to derive meaningful insights about customer purchase behavior and product affinities.
- Presented the findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, demonstrating strong analytical and communication skills.

## Dataset

The market basket dataset used in this project contains transactional data, where each row represents a customer's purchase with the associated products bought in that transaction. The dataset was anonymized and carefully prepared to maintain data privacy.
