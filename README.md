# Bachelor's Project: Market Basket Analysis

This repository contains my Bachelor's project titled "Market Basket Analysis." The project focuses on applying the Apriori model to analyze a market basket dataset, identifying significant patterns and correlations in customer purchasing behavior. The aim is to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations for business improvement.

## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique widely used in retail and e-commerce to uncover associations and relationships between products that are frequently purchased together. By understanding these patterns, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, improve cross-selling opportunities, and enhance the overall customer shopping experience.

In this project, I leveraged the Apriori algorithm, a classic association rule mining technique, to analyze a real-world market basket dataset. The goal was to identify interesting and actionable relationships between products that could potentially lead to valuable business insights.

## Project Highlights

- Utilized the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from the market basket dataset.
- Performed extensive data preprocessing and data cleaning to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis results.
- Interpreted the extracted association rules to derive meaningful insights about customer purchase behavior and product affinities.
- Presented the findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, demonstrating strong analytical and communication skills.

## Dataset

The market basket dataset used in this project contains transactional data, where each row represents a customer's purchase with the associated products bought in that transaction. The dataset was anonymized and carefully prepared to maintain data privacy.
